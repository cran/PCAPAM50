PCAPAM50 is used to perform intrinsic subtyping for breast cancer gene expression data. PCAPAM50 leverages principal component analysis (PCA) and iterative PAM50 calls to derive the gene expression-based ER status. This generates an ER-balanced subset which is automatically used for gene centering and subsequent intrinsic calls. Thus, PCAPAM50 performs intrinsic subtyping in ER status unbalanced cohorts.


#~ The package comes with a sample/TEST PAM50 matrix to demostrate runing the program.
####~~ 'TEST.ihc' and 'TEST.matrix' is provided ----subtitute these to make calls for your data
####~~ To make conventional intrinsic call that is only using IHC, use the function "makeCalls.ihc"
####~~ Refer to the Vignette to know more

###~~~~Prerequisites

##~~ Hardware
Package should run on any computer (Linux/Unix, Windows or Mac) with R installed. However it is tested only on Linux/Ubuntu and Windows.


##~~Software
